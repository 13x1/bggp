Target File Type: AutoHotkey 1.1 script
SHA256 Hash: %HASH%
Target Environment (How do we run the file?): Double-click the file in Explorer with AutoHotkey 1.1 installed
Any additional info?: Do NOT compile it, run it as a script (the default). Also, using AHK 1.1 instead of 2 because I can't be bothered to update autohotkey on my windows box.
