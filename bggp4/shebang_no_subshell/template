Target File Type: Shebang only (without subshell spawning)
SHA256 Hash: %HASH%
Target Environment (How do we run the file?): chmod +x [file] && ./[file]
Any additional info?: The whole file is *just* a shebang, *without spawning any subshells*. Assuming that the GNU coreutils are present, running on Arch Linux (which has /bin/env). Also, this produces a file called x04, which is 4 in hexadecimal. I read through all man pages and even parts of the coreutils source code, and to my knowledge it's impossible to get "4" without a subshell, but hex 4 is possible, so I am submitting this.
