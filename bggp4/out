Any additional info?: 135 bytes. Displays 4 (or $4 to be precise) in the error message. You might need root to run this on port 4, but had to use a short port for those sweet sweet saved bytes.

Target File Type: SelfXSS (javascript: URL)
SHA256 Hash: e1ccc7be78fce2d1c16dfb9eee2fb08765811318e6365a2724dbcdf142e6ff58
Target Environment (How do we run the file?): This one is a bit more complicated, because browsers have a selfXSS protection. You have to paste the URL, but it will delete the text "javascript:". You have to *manually type* that on the beginning of the URL and inside the btoa() call so it matches with the source again. Then just hit enter and enjoy the show. Also, you need to be on a website that doesn't block javascript: URLs via CSP, so I recommend running this on https://example.com/.
Any additional info?: 102 bytes. Some browsers enforce a file ending in the file picker, but the actual name (as you can see in the screenshot) is 4.

Target File Type: Shebang only (without subshell spawning)
SHA256 Hash: 0196ff3b228266bbfcda2a7b7e7f9667c318add94a44642f5fb516cd89d422e0
Target Environment (How do we run the file?): chmod +x [file] && ./[file]
Any additional info?: 45 bytes. The whole file is *just* a shebang, *without spawning any subshells*. Assuming that the GNU coreutils are present, running on Arch Linux (which has /bin/env). Also, this produces a file called x04, which is 4 in hexadecimal. I read through all man pages and even parts of the coreutils source code, and to my knowledge it's impossible to get "4" without a subshell, but hex 4 is possible, so I am submitting this.

Any additional info?: 47 bytes. Assuming that the GNU coreutils and GNU Netcat are installed on the server. Tested on Arch Linux, using wget as the HTTP downloader, but any other HTTP downloader should work. Might need root to bind on privileged ports.
