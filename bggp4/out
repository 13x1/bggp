Any additional info?: 147 bytes. You might need root to run this on port 4, but had to use a short port for those sweet sweet saved bytes.

Target File Type: SelfXSS (javascript: URL)
SHA256 Hash: d014b70d78a86f7effed5255453513ed046350324b1b74adda4c7f51d52152ac
Target Environment (How do we run the file?): This one is a bit more complicated, because browsers have a selfXSS protection. You have to paste the URL, but it will delete the text "javascript:". You have to *manually type* that on the beginning of the URL and inside the btoa() call so it matches with the source again. Then just hit enter and enjoy the show. Also, you need to be on a website that doesn't block javascript: URLs via CSP, so I recommend running this on https://example.com/.
Any additional info?: 112 bytes. Some browsers enforce a file ending in the file picker, but the actual name (as you can see in the screenshot) is 4.

Target File Type: Shebang only (without subshell spawning)
SHA256 Hash: 0196ff3b228266bbfcda2a7b7e7f9667c318add94a44642f5fb516cd89d422e0
Target Environment (How do we run the file?): chmod +x [file] && ./[file]
Any additional info?: 45 bytes. The whole file is *just* a shebang, *without spawning any subshells*. Assuming that the GNU coreutils are present, running on Arch Linux (which has /bin/env). Also, this produces a file called x04, which is 4 in hexadecimal. I read through all man pages and even parts of the coreutils source code, and to my knowledge it's impossible to get "4" without a subshell, but hex 4 is possible, so I am submitting this.
