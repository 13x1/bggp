Target File Type: Bash HTTP server
SHA256 Hash: %HASH%
Target Environment (How do we run the file?): Two terminals: one running `[sudo] bash [filename]`, the other running `wget 127.0.0.1:4/4`.
Any additional info?: Assuming that the GNU coreutils and GNU Netcat are installed on the server. Tested on Arch Linux, using wget as the HTTP downloader, but any other HTTP downloader should work. Might need root to bind on privileged ports.
